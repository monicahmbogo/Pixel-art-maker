# Pixel-art-maker project.

This is the 7 day code challenge which is the last challenge of this program.

In this challenge, we were given a project to create a web app that allows the user to create a table of any size, choose a color using the color picker, and on clicking on the table cells sets the color you choose.
This project has allowed me to use most if not all of the skills I have learnt throughout this lovely program.

Its a fun app hope you have lots of fun playing around with it.

Enjoy the app! https://monicahmbogo.github.io/Pixel-art-maker/
