# Pixel-art-maker project.

This is the 7 day code challenge.

In this project, I have created a web app that allows the user to create a table of any size, choose a color using the color picker, and on clicking on the table cells sets the color you choose.

Its a fun app hope you have much fun playing around with it. Enjoy!
